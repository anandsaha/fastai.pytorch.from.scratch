# pytorch.model.training
I am implementing from scratch the tools, techniques and best practices I learnt from fast.ai's 2017 offering.

The idea is to _not_ use the [fastai](https://github.com/fastai/fastai/tree/master/fastai) library and build everything minimally on PyTorch, to see things happening first hand.

Targets:

### Data Loading

[checkbox:unchecked] Load from folders segregated into classes
[checkbox:unchecked] Load from csv files assigning classes to images
