# pytorch.model.training
I am implementing from scratch the tools, techniques and best practices I learnt from fast.ai's 2017 offering.

The idea is to _not_ use the [fastai](https://github.com/fastai/fastai/tree/master/fastai) library and build everything minimally on PyTorch, to see things happening first hand.


### Data Loading

- [ ] Load from folders segregated into classes
- [ ] Load from csv files assigning classes to images


### Data Augmentation

- [ ] Horizontal flip
- [ ] Cropping center
- [ ] Cropping random
- [ ] Cropping custom
- [ ] Scalling

### Learning Rate

- [ ] Optimum learning rate finder
- [ ] LR Annealing

### Model Training

- [ ] Using pretrained weights
- [ ] Freezing layers
- [ ] Precompute activations
- [ ] Delete/Add Layers


### Test time techniques

- [ ] Test Time Augmentation (TTA)
